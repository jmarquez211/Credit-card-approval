Understand dataset (credit)
ID: An identifier for each individual, likely a unique number assigned to each record.

MONTHS_BALANCE: This column probably represents the month of the record in relation to some reference point. It could be a relative month, indicating the number of months before or after a specific event or time. Positive values may represent months after a reference point, while negative values may represent months before.

STATUS: This column likely contains information about the credit status of the individual for a particular month. The "STATUS" column might include different codes or labels indicating the credit performance or behavior of the individual in that specific month. For example, it could include values like "C" for closed, "D" for overdue, "0" for no DPD (Days Past Due), etc. The exact codes used would depend on the data provider or the system used to record credit status.
