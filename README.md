# Credit Card Approval
Welcome to the Credit Card Approval project! This repository contains everything you need to understand and explore the process of credit card approval through data analysis, machine learning, and interpretability techniques. Whether you're a data enthusiast, a machine learning practitioner, or someone simply curious about how credit card approvals work, this project offers a comprehensive and accessible approach.

Project Overview
This project is centered around the analysis and modeling of credit card application data. The main goal is to predict whether an applicant should be approved for a credit card based on various features provided in the datasets.

Datasets
application_record.csv: This dataset contains the raw application records of individuals applying for a credit card. It includes various demographic and financial features.

credit_record.csv: This dataset complements the application records by providing historical credit information of the applicants, which helps in understanding their credit behavior.

df_good.csv: This is the cleaned and processed dataset, derived from the two main datasets mentioned above. It is ready for use in machine learning models and further analysis.

Web Application
To make the insights and models more accessible, we've created a web application using Streamlit. This app allows users to interact with the data, visualize key features, and explore the machine learning models used in the project.

You can access the web application here: Credit Card Approval App

Features
Data Exploration: Explore the datasets, understand the distribution of features, and gain insights through visualizations.

Modeling: See how different machine learning models perform in predicting credit card approval, and understand the impact of different features on the predictions.

Interpretability: Dive deep into model interpretability to understand the decision-making process of the machine learning models.

Conclusion: Summarizes the findings and insights drawn from the analysis and modeling.
